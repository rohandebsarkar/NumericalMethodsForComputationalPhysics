    "# Ising Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model is a mathematical model used in statistical mechanics to study phase transitions in physical systems, particularly in magnetism. It was proposed by the physicist Ernst Ising in 1925 to describe the behavior of magnetic spins in a lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Ising model, each lattice site can be in one of two states, typically represented as \"up\" or \"down\" spins. The interactions between neighboring spins are taken into account, described by an energy function that depends on the alignment of neighboring spins. When spins are aligned, the energy is lowered, while misaligned spins increase the energy.\n",
